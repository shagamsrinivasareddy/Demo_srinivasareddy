# Autonomous Drone Navigation using Reinforcement Learning

## Description
This project demonstrates an autonomous drone navigation system using Reinforcement Learning (Deep Q-Networks). The drone learns to navigate in a 3D environment while avoiding obstacles and optimizing its path towards a goal.

## Features
- Uses **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** for decision-making.
- Simulates a **3D grid environment** with obstacles.
- **Dynamic visualization** using Plotly.
- Implements **reward-based learning** to optimize movement.

## Installation
### Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main script to train the agent and visualize the results:
```sh
python drone_navigation.py
```

## Files
- **drone_navigation.py** - Main code for RL-based drone navigation.
- **requirements.txt** - List of dependencies.
- **README.md** - Project documentation.

## Future Scope
- Implement **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** with neural networks.
- Train the model on real-world drone data.
- Introduce **dynamic obstacles** for a more complex environment.
